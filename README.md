# Deep-Learning

# Classification Model
Custom CNN model was used for classification

# Segmentation Model
ResUNet Architecture was used for segmentation model

# Interface file -> app.py
To run app.py write pip install -r requirements.txt on the terminal

# Dataset for classification:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/murtozalikhon/brain-tumor-multimodal-image-ct-and-mri
This dataset contains CT and MRI scans of brain. We only used MRI scans for training our model

# Dataset for segmentation:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation
This dataset contains brain MRI scans along with the segmenatation mask of the tumor if the tumor is present
